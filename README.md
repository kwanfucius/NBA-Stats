# NBA-Stats
Hall of fame players and all-star players dramatically escalate the publicity, therefore the sales of teams. There are only 177 in NBA history that are inducted into the hall of fame and 431 players selected for an all-star game held every year. To put in perspective only 3.6% percent of players make the hall of fame and only 8.7% of players have made an all-star game.  So, the motivation of this analysis is to give general managers a model to best predict players that will promulgate their brand. The key variables we look at are if players are inducted into the hall of fame, if they make it to the all-star team, and their salaries. Analysis will be presented for each of these variables individually to prevent multicollinearity.
